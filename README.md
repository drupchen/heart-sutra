# heart-sutra

linebreak means verse number change
1 empty line means a linebreak
2 empty lines means a paragraph break
4 spaces/1 tab means verses
the rest of the markup is left as is
all lines not starting with usfm tags are counted as verses
to not count one line as a verse, have it start with '\ '
in commentaries, it is the opposite : mark with '\ ' the lines that start a verse

if not in commentary mode, any ' \ ' string will be simply deleted 

3 usfm files:
- tables with tibetan, phon, w2w
- litteral translation
- standard version
